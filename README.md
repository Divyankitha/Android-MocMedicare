# MocMedicare
This application acts as a bridge between patients and doctors. Using the applications, patients can connect with doctors on a day to day basis. They can book appointments with the doctor, make video calls with doctor for virtual health checkup, send data like heart rate to doctors, contact their emergency contact person in one click. On the other hand, doctors can monitor the patients, conduct virtual health checkups and mail prescriptions directly to the pharmacy. Also, the application will detect the fall of the patient and notifies the care taker via an SMS.
